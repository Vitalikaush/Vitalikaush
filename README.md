⚡ Fun fact:

During my honeymoon, my wife and I embarked on a cross-country adventure from California to New York, visiting some of America's most stunning national parks. We've danced to 'Sweet Dreams' by Eurythmics in our living room, taken spontaneous beach trips with our kids, and climbed the awe-inspiring routes in Moab, Utah. Life is full of amazing moments.
